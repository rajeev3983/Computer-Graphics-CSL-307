Dave-3D
=======
Implemented a short 3-D version of the classic game Dave with an animation of Rube-Goldberge machine in at the end of the game.

Game:
The aim of the game is to solve the maze and take our XOLO(character's name) to the exit point.
Movements of the character can be done using arrow keys.
Their will be certain obstacles,like big balls guarding several paths.
To pass through exit door,XOLO needs to find the door key in maze and for that he may have to traverse whole maze.
For making the life of users(who are finding the game difficult) a bit easy,we have a cheat code in our game.By pressing c,map will be visible

Exit of XOLO from maze will be followed by Rube Goldberg Model.
